8,1,0.998123975,Look this is a very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured. I couldn't imagine what it'd be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if in fact they said by the way the last six months of your life you're on your own. We're cutting off. You've used up your time.
9,1,0.991264347,The fact of the matter is that the quickest fastest way to do it is build on Obama Care to build on what we did.
11,1,0.987436035,Takes down Obama Care and any republican who wants to get rid of it.
16,1,0.995772669,The other thing is folks look we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with insurance companies by number one putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading'their misleading advertising
28,1,0.993304504,I did not oppose bussing in America. What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed. I did not oppose'
52,1,0.983910504,Informed consent of the American people.
63,1,0.99691127,If you noticed there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer based insurance. And in fact you know this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward you can't beat President Trump with doubletalk on this plan.
88,1,0.987436035,With regard to  with regard to the secretary's point I already proposed and passed
89,1,0.993304504,$750 million for Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.
93,1,0.99691127,I agree with the Senator. The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it. It has nothing to do with that section of law. That's what he's doing number one. Number two we should in fact  and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration I proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.
103,1,0.996315899,Right now we're in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation. They shouldn't be going to prison. When in prison they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.
104,1,0.996062934,And when they get out of prison they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before including Pell grants for education including making sure that they're able to have housing public housing including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.
119,1,0.994004598,Along came a federal judge and said enough enough. And he freed 1000 of these people. If you doubt me google 1000 prisoners freed Kamala Harris.
131,1,0.99241929,Number three number three I also was asked as the mayor of Detroit can tell you by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet. I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that.
157,1,0.977634638, Thank you. Thank you very much. And thank you Mr. Mayor for Detroit hosting this.
170,1,0.991264347,But guess what? Of the 160 million people who like their health care now they can keep it. If they don't like it they can leave. Number one.
180,1,0.995772669, I know a lot about cancer let me tell you something. It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.
191,1,0.995772669,The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation.
201,1,0.994004598,So the point is things have changed. And things have changed a lot. And now what's happening is ' and by the way the way Beto handled ' excuse me for saying Beto. What the congressman
231,1,0.989694234,You want ICE the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants.
247,1,0.996315899, Well they have to deal with the ' look there's institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved I started dealing with that. Redlining banks making sure that we are in a position where ' look you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools
258,1,0.997069151,And so I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything family and could be judged on based how you treatment your family and how you went from there. And I ' it took ' you know Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark. Right after I got elected my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident and my two sons were badly injured. And I just had been elected
265,1,0.994004598,And what I wanted to make a point about ' and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.
273,1,0.99241929,And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50000 and $75000 a year their taxes are going to go up about $5
278,1,0.993304504,Secondly  I mean thirdly what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to  we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.
281,1,0.64358341, No one is supporting billionaires.
283,1,0.997665732,It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history  excuse me in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is I've never seen a time  and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places in Syria and in Iraq and guess what? Our commanders across the board
295,1,0.994004598,I'm the only one that got  got  moved the  to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That would change it.
322,1,0.987436035, This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.
324,1,0.996062934,"And on his death bed he asked me to do his eulogy. John I would say to John ""John you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight."" And he'd say ""You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve."" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable."
326,1,0.995772669,Secondly we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.
352,1,0.989694234, Yes and I said it at the time. Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact
372,1,0.996062934, Well I don't think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighborhoods and middleclass neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed. And the working class has no way up as a consequence of that.
374,1,0.997458827,The middle class is not as behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate a significant number of these godawful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in health care. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middleclass people so they can maintain their standard of living.
375,1,0.995041532,That's not being done. And the idea that we're growing  we're not growing. The wealthy very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are. And that's why we must change this presidency now.
409,1,0.991264347,Number two the idea that the senator suggested that I am in the pocket of billionaires when in fact they oppose everything that I have ever done and continue to do
415,1,0.994004598,They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will benefit from it every single American. And you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants. That's who we are. That's why we're who we are. That's what makes us different. And we should invest in them.
433,1,0.977634638, It's going to increase personal taxes. There are going to be
436,1,0.994572145,My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between 20 and 100 people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them I'm here. I give them my private phone number. They keep in touch with me.
1,2,0.995041532,What I meant by that is look Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middleclass Americans built America.
7,2,0.991264347,And so folks there's a lot we can do but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century. We're not doing that now.
17,2,0.996062934,What they're doing paying doctors to prescribe. We should'we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare'that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what'whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we in fact allow people'you mean time's up?
19,2,0.997340982,Second thing we have to do the law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents. And lastly the idea that he is in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed do not need a blanket do not need a toothbrush'
24,2,0.997340982,That's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true number one. Number two if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not I'm happy to do that. I was a public defender. I didn't become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact '
53,2,0.997665732,Thank you very much. I am running to leave this country because I think it is important we restore the soul of this nation. This President has ripped it out. He is the only President in our history who has equated racist and'and white supremacist with ordinary decent people. He is the only President who is that in engaged and embraced dictators and thumb their nose at our allies.
55,2,0.996062934,Lastly we've got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we can't. If we do there's not a single thing the American people can't do. This is the United States of America. We can do anything if we're together together. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
66,2,0.99756667, My response is Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do  take back all the things that Trump took away provide a public option meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan or if they're on Medicaid they'd automatically be in the plan.
94,2,0.997211676,This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people. And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country. That's why we're so special. It took courage. It took resilience. It took absolutely confidence for them to come. And we should be encouraging these people.
98,2,0.993304504, I was vice president. I am not the president. I keep my recommendation to him in private. Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. That is not what I do.
99,2,0.983910504,What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system. That's what he did. That's who did. But much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.
100,2,0.989694234, The fact is that's what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants. All of us. All of us. Some here came against their will; others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives. And they did.
102,2,0.989694234, Well I don't  I think he is wrong. I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.
143,2,0.989694234,As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself I have some idea what it cost.
163,2,0.997665732,Look this is the United States of America. There has never been a single solitary time when we've set our mind to something we've been unable to do it. We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me. We're the bestequipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There's enormous enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.
174,2,0.898283932, This is America.
179,2,0.99241929, Well let me tell you something. For a socialist you've got ' for a socialist you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.
199,2,0.996735411,There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50 percent of gun ' of gun ' of members of the NRA supporting them and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.
203,2,0.983910504, to understand those parents you understand the heartache.
220,2,0.963331876, The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.
232,2,0.995436198,So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrive legally but overstay their visas? And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who want to migrate to the U.S.?
242,2,0.898283932,I said something that was not meant the way I said it.
276,2,0.996735411,I would double it because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make  in fact pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is  like I said  the  a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.
327,2,0.996315899,And lastly we have to unite the country because folks it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake get up. Get up and remember
354,2,0.996735411,And with regard to China we should  look unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China what they're doing with the million Uighurs that are there essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally
356,2,0.996062934,The fact is that what happens now is that we in fact have to fundamentally change the culture the culture of how women are treated. That's why as vice president  and when I asked the president I could start the movement on the college campuses to say it's on us. It's everyone's responsibility.
358,2,0.997458827,And that's when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in selfdefense and that's  rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture period and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big  no I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue. And we have to make it clear from the top
367,2,0.99756667,Folks we are in a position where we have  we're the wealthiest nation in the world our workers are more productive than workers around the world three times as productive as workers in Asia. We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined. We're in a position where we've led not by the example of our power but by the power of our example.
368,2,0.995041532,I'm so tired of everybody walking around like woe is me what are we going to do? Let's remember this is the United States of America. There has never ever ever been a time when we have set our mind to do something we've been unable to do it. Never. Never never.
369,2,0.989694234,So it's time to remember get up let's take back this country and lead the world again. It's within our power to do it. Get up and take it back.
388,2,0.898283932,And lastly I think that
413,2,0.995041532, Look let me  since I haven't spoken on this I've got a chance. Number one the reason we're the country we are is because of immigration. We've been able to cherry pick the best from every single continent.
418,2,0.99691127,Rebuilding that country as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an antiterrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America.
419,2,0.997211676,The first thing I would do as president of the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home entered into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism.
428,2,0.898283932, That's not true.
443,2,0.987436035,God bless you all and may you have a great great holiday season. And thank you guys for doing this as well.
2,3,0.996735411,My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity it's about respect it's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be okay. Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
48,3,0.996062934,And lastly we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It's within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers not the NRA the gun manufacturers.
56,3,0.987436035, Tonight I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here. And I expect we'll get it.
57,3,0.996315899,I'm running for president to restore the soul of this country. You know we have a president as everybody has acknowledged here every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country but no one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It's too strong. We're too good.
64,3,0.991264347, The plan no matter how you cut it costs $3 trillion when it is in fact employed number one. Ten years from now
68,3,0.99241929,In the meantime what happens? Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost? My plan costs $750 billion. That's what it costs. Not $30 trillion.
79,3,0.977634638,They are misrepresenting to the American people what needs to be done.
113,3,0.989694234, We did a lot. Number one we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38000 people number one.
120,3,0.996538319, There is no middle ground about my plan. The fact of the matter is I call for the immediate action to be taken. First of all one of the things that  we're responsible for 15 percent of all the pollution in the country. He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods particularly poor neighborhoods
127,3,0.995436198,We will double offshore wind. We will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel. But we have to also engage the world while we're doing it. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
128,3,0.983910504, No we would  we would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those either  any fossil fuel.
139,3,0.898283932,The answer is yes.
148,3,0.996062934,You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful. I'm passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally. I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president.
150,3,0.993304504, The fact is that the senator knows that that's not position. Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point.
166,3,0.99756667,Number two I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion $3.4 trillion a year it turns out is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before ' exists now without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.
167,3,0.993304504,Thus far my distinguished friend the senator on my left has not indicated how she pays for it. And the senator has in fact come forward and said how he's going to pay for it
202,3,0.991264347, The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful to look in the eyes of those people to see those kids
207,3,0.977634638, Let's be constitutional. We've got a Constitution.
240,3,0.994572145,We don't need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford's a fine guy but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.
264,3,0.994572145, Look my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.
268,3,0.963331876, Anderson ' Anderson â€¦
272,3,0.996062934,But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.
279,3,0.997069151,And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.
284,3,0.996315899,What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that in fact where he's going to have a problem  because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.
308,3,0.996315899, Well I think their vision is attracting a lot of people and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But you know Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do how we're going to get it done
309,3,0.997069151,I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we in fact took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression making us  putting us in a position where I was able to end roe  excuse me
310,3,0.996538319,And so the question is who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost how you're going to do it and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.
311,3,0.996538319, Well the senator said  she's being vague on the issue of  actually both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No look here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion  it's more than the entire federal budget  let me finish OK?
316,3,0.898283932, By the way the greed and
325,3,0.996735411,And one of the things  that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact this president has ripped the soul out of this country divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar he cheats he does not do anything to promote people generally.
329,3,0.993304504,You have to ask yourself up here who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place to win the presidency in the first place? And secondly who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?
332,3,0.993304504, Who is most likely to do what needs to be done produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate maintain the House and beat Trump?
334,3,0.995772669, It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it makes sense.
337,3,0.997458827, I think a woman is qualified to be president and there's no reason why  if you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is number one I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate I've passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined
340,3,0.99691127, Look I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That's not the role of the president of the United States. It's the attorney general of the United States not the president's attorney private attorney.
343,3,0.994572145,Look it's just  look it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country. And that's not who we are that's not who we've been that's not who we should be. Follow the law let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted
362,3,0.983910504, No I said the first. I said the first AfricanAmerican woman. The first AfricanAmerican woman.
366,3,0.996315899,You know the American people have an enormous opportunity. There's an incredible  incredible  I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career and I got elected when I was a 29yearold kid to the United States Senate.
370,3,0.995436198, You know Judy it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did. And you know Trump's response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now I find
376,3,0.996062934, The answer is yes. The answer is yes because the opportunity  the opportunity for those workers to transition to highpaying jobs as Tom said is real. We're the only country in the world that's ever taken great great crises and turned them into enormous opportunities.
396,3,0.963331876, And I'm going to guess
405,3,0.983910504, Politico doesn't have much of a sense of humor.
430,3,0.977634638,I'm the only guy that's not interrupted.
431,3,0.995436198,I'm the only guy that's not interrupted here all right? And I'm going to interrupt now. It costs $30 trillion. Let's get that straight $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs $20 trillion. Some say it costs $40 trillion.
435,3,0.996062934, I think everyone up here on this stage and those who are not on this stage who've run we owe them because they're all pushing for the exact same thing. You're not the only one that does selfies Senator. I've done thousands of them thousands of them. And the crew that follows me can tell you
440,3,0.99241929,Number two who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate in states like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other states?
442,3,0.996062934,And so I think asking those questions I believe as you would expect that I'm the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all we've got to level with the American people. Don't play games with them. Tell them the truth and be authentic.
6,4,0.998713341,I'm still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you look the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education. The fact is that that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That's why I think we should have universal PreK. That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school'65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That's why there should be free community college cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out they're making less than $25000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on.
15,4,0.998060518,But here's the deal. The deal is that he's right about three things. Number one they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country but they also'for example they've increased the lifespan of Social Security because they're'they have a job. They're paying the Social Security tax. That's what they're doing. It's increase the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis.
22,4,0.995041532,close to immoral. But the fact is that look we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance as we did why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them
58,4,0.993304504,Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds went on to be mayors senators governors congresswomen
112,4,0.997211676,And the fact of the matter is secondly there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt. Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007 when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?
140,4,0.987436035, Well I love your affection for me. You spend a lot of time with me.
147,4,0.99691127,I wrote the Violence against Women Act. Lilly Ledbetter. I was deeply involved in making sure the equal pay amendments. I was deeply involved on all these things. I came up with the it's on us proposal to see to it that women were treated more decently on college campuses.
151,4,0.996735411,The Hyde Amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately. But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact be have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government everyone that  that could no longer stand.
176,4,0.963331876, George 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds?
177,4,0.997340982, Fifteen seconds. Look everybody says we want an option. The option I'm proposing is Medicareforall ' Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare if you lose the job from your insurance ' from your employer you automatically can buy into this. You don't have ' no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered period.
181,4,0.99241929,And we're talking four six eight ten years depending on who you talk about before we get to Medicareforall. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now
194,4,0.778142202,When you finish your term in prison you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants have access to be able to get housing
205,4,0.898283932, We are ready to do this.
237,4,0.99691127, No it wasn't wrong to pull out. But I want to answer your Afghanistan question. I've been in and out of Afghanistan not with a gun and I admire my friend for his service. But I've been out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this ' and it's an open secret you reported a long time ago George
269,4,0.996315899, Look my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware we never discussed anything so there would be no potential conflict.
271,4,0.584271299, First of all the plan we're hearing discussed is the  plan the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.
282,4,0.997340982, I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq which are in retreat now being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.
285,4,0.994572145, I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover those thousand troops that are being  having to withdraw under fire make it clear that they're not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what in fact
296,4,0.987436035, Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged.
298,4,0.998060518,It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run why I decided to run this time because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act
306,4,0.994004598,And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan who used to work for me to others that they in fact
312,4,0.99241929, If you eliminated the entire Pentagon every single thing plane ship troop the buildings
317,4,0.996315899, The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.
319,4,0.977634638, You did a hell of a job in your job.
348,4,0.997458827, Well first of all I'd go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before since he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they wanted creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jongun who's a thug  although he points out that I'm a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick very recently was his comment.
355,4,0.995436198, Yes. And by the way it's one of the reasons  the first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization which I wrote. The fact  I didn't write the reauthorization. I wrote the original act.
371,4,0.994004598,You know we need to restore the integrity of the presidency the office of the presidency and it's about time we get that underway. My job and I think the job of all of us up here is to in fact  well that's not true
373,4,0.995436198,You have for example farmers in the Midwest 40 percent of them couldn't pay their bills last year. You have most Americans if they received a bill for $400 or more they'd have to sell something or borrow the money.
378,4,0.996315899,We have enormous opportunities. For example you talk about would we relocate people who in fact were in a position where they lost their home? We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild with the standard that exists today.
393,4,0.99241929,Secondly we in fact should make sure that we begin to rebuild our alliances which Trump has demolished with Japan and South Korea
414,4,0.996538319,The people who come here have determination resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We have 24 out of every 100 children in our schools today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but it's bad for America.
424,4,0.996538319,But now that it's been exposed that taking it away has such dire consequences I've added to the Obamacare plan the  initiative which is a public option Medicare if you want to have Medicare reducing significantly the price of drugs
43,5,0.995772669,I think you've so underestimated what Barack Obama did. He's the first man to bring together the entire world 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately.
46,5,0.995041532,Okay. I'm the only person that's beaten the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that got the Brady Bill passed the background checks number one.
105,5,0.995436198,That's the essence of what my plan in detail lays out. I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to. And so I  you know I look  anyway that's what I think my plan  I know what my plan does and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.
111,5,0.994004598, Number one the bill he talks about is a bill that in my  our administration we passed. We passed that bill that you added onto. That's the bill in fact you passed.
121,5,0.997665732,But h's the deal; in area there's also another piece. Eightyfive percent of it is something I helped negotiate; and that is the Paris Climate Accord. I would immediately rejoin that Paris Accord. I would make sure that we up the ante which it calls for. I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know I  I convene them in the White House like we did in nuclear summit and I would raise the standard.
123,5,0.987436035,  in research for new alternatives to deal with climate change.
129,5,0.994004598, Because we did it. I was asked to manage an $87 billion plan that would be spent in a total of 18 months that revived this state and many others because  and it kept us out of a depression with 0.2% of waste or fraud.
135,5,0.998060518, I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted. Otherwise they're going to do exactly what they're doing fill the vacuum and run the  and run the table.
162,5,0.997211676,I refuse to postpone giving single child in America no matter their Zip code preK all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.
172,5,0.99691127,The senator said before it's going to cost you in your pay ' there will be a deductible in your paycheck. You're going to ' the middle class person someone making 60 grand with three kids they're going to end up paying $5000 more. They're going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax. That's a reality. Now
190,5,0.996735411,I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman ' as a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate et cetera.
192,5,0.996735411,Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As ' when we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers not prisons.
200,5,0.99241929,Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street ' period. And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
208,5,0.994572145," No what I said was ' the question ' speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say ""By the way you can't own the following weapons period; they cannot be sold anymore"" ' check with constitutional scholars. Now you can say"
211,5,0.996735411,Number two ' number two by the time ' this is a president who came along with the DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who's done a great deal. So I'm proud to have served with him.
213,5,0.993304504,I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
235,5,0.994572145,In addition to that we're in a position where if we don't set the rules we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China
238,5,0.995772669,The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency meaning that we're going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again. It will not be put together. It's three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties ' the three provinces in the east. They're not any part of ' the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on.
239,5,0.996735411,But here's the point. The point is that it's a counterterrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases ' insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know.
249,5,0.997458827,The teachers are ' I'm married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have ' make sure that every single child does in fact have 3 4 and 5yearolds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.
253,5,0.996538319,Number two you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I'm the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries in fact changed their system so people don't have to chance to leave. You're all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.
294,5,0.997211676,The way to deal with those guns and those AR15s and assault weapons that are on the street  or not on the street that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.
336,5,0.995436198,But here's the deal they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies  they want no  no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.
345,5,0.997211676, Distinction should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That's one question. He's very close to  he's indicted himself. Number two after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general.
346,5,0.998341084, Yeah I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It's the numberone issue. And I might add I don't really need a kind of a lecture from  from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a gamechanger while I managed the $90 billion recovery plan investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it my friend was introducing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world
347,5,0.994004598,Now he's  I welcome him back into the fold here and he's been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are let's get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of all time.
353,5,0.995436198,And I would also as pointed out I would end  end subsidies that we have end the sale of material to the Saudis where they're going in and murdering children and they're murdering innocent people. And so they have to be held accountable.
377,5,0.994572145,I've met with the union leaders. For example we should in fact be making that  making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained that it doesn't leak energy that
383,5,0.987436035,But the fact is we have to  we have to be able to get things done. And when we can't convince them we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states.
385,5,0.996735411,Look what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel there's no solution for Israel other than a twostate solution. It does not exist. It's not possible to have a Jewish state in the Middle East without there being a twostate solution.
386,5,0.994004598,And he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in Israel. Bibi Netanyahu and I know one another well. He knows that I think what he's doing is outrageous.
387,5,0.994572145,What we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the Israelis to move to a twostate solution not withdraw physical aid from them in terms of their security.
402,5,0.963331876, More like Winston Churchill.
406,5,0.991264347, No I'm not willing to commit one way or another. Here's the deal. I'm not even elected one term yet and let's see where we are. Let's see what happens.
407,5,0.898283932,But it's a nice thought.
421,5,0.835123035, I'm talking about the White House.
10,6,0.989694234,And secondly secondly to make sure that everyone does have an option. Everyone whether they have private insurance employer insurance or no insurance they
12,6,0.987436035,I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. I didn't hear.
20,6,0.898283932,That is outrageous.
21,6,0.996315899,Depending if they committed a'a major crime they should be deported. And the President was left in his'President Obama I think did a heck of a job. To compare him to what'what this guy is doing is absolutely I find'
27,6,0.996315899,But'so the bottom line here is look everything I have done in my career'I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights. And those civil rights by the way include not just African Americans
36,6,0.643579329,But sometimes you can't do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states over 60 candidates'
42,6,0.997757044,And new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy but economy that can create millions of jobs. But I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that accord which it calls for because we make up 15 percent of the problem; 85 percent of the world makes up the rest. And so we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world bring them together
59,6,0.991264347,Mr. President this is America. And we are stronger and great because of this diversity Mr. President not in spite of it Mr. President.
67,6,0.993304504,It would take place immediately. It would move quickly. And it would insure the vast vast vast majority of Americans.
69,6,0.993304504, My plan makes a limit of copay to be $10 because we further support the  the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.
70,6,0.994004598,Secondly the idea that this is somehow a bad idea no one has to keep their private insurance but they  if they like their insurance they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.
71,6,0.991264347,It says if the 160 million who have it say they like their employer insurance they should have a right to have it. If they don't they can buy into the  plan which is Obamacare with 
72,6,0.995436198,My plan does  will cover everyone number one. Number two the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices. The biopharma is now where things are going to go. It's no longer chemicals. It's about all these breakthroughs that we have with the whole  excuse me immune system.
73,6,0.995436198,And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says as you develop a drug you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price. And secondly it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.
74,6,0.996538319,This is not a Republican talking point. The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat 100 million people with preexisting conditions. And in fact what we got is a public option that in fact would allow anybody to buy in.
75,6,0.996538319,No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan. And they can buy into it with $1000 deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it. And if they don't have any money they'll get in free. So this idea is a bunch of malarkey what we're talking about here.
78,6,0.993304504,Number two we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for of the $9 billion opioids they sell out there.
82,6,0.898283932,Three million 
84,6,0.898283932,Three million 
85,6,0.977634638,I don't know if you can hear. I can hear. But anyway
106,6,0.987436035, The fact is that the bills that the president  that excuse me the future president here  that
107,6,0.995041532, that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelming. Since 2007 I for example tried to get the crackpowdercocaine totally  disparity totally eliminated.
130,6,0.993304504,Secondly I was part of the organization  and within our administration  that pushed bailing General Motors out saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state.
133,6,0.997211676, I'd renegotiate. We make up 25 percent of the world's economy. In order  either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.
134,6,0.995436198,And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now in the things that make them more competitive. That's what we have to do. Otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.
144,6,0.995772669,I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $8000 tax credit now. That would put 700000 women back to work increase the GDP by almost 8/10 of 1 percent. It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things why can't we do it this way?
152,6,0.995772669,I support a woman's right to choose. I support it's a constitutional right. I've supported it and I will continue to support it and I will in fact move as president to see to it that the Congress legislates that that is the laws as well.
164,6,0.993304504,Democratic presidential candidates debate in Houston. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)
165,6,0.997211676, That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I think ' I know that the senator says she's for Bernie well I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it replace everything that has been cut add a public option guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance
175,6,0.977634638, One hundred fortynine million.
182,6,0.898283932, You just described my plan.
183,6,0.963331876, They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.
233,6,0.994004598, Yeah well look we're either going to make policy or China's going to make the rules of the road. We make up 25 percent of the world economy. We need another 25 percent to join us.
243,6,0.995436198,I said ' from that point on ' what I was argued against in the beginning once he started to put the troops in was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way; there was no plan; we should not be engaged; we didn't have the people with us; we didn't have our ' we didn't have allies with us et cetera.
250,6,0.997665732,It's not want they don't want to help. They don't ' they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio make sure the television ' excuse me make sure you have the record player on at night the ' the ' make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school ' a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.
251,6,0.963331876, There's so much we ' no I'm going to go like the rest of them do twice over okay?
266,6,0.997665732,On the ' look the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions ' three occasions ' has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.
275,6,0.99691127, No look demonizing wealth  what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea  we have to start rewarding work not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax  I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent.
313,6,0.983910504, We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.
330,6,0.996735411,And by the way I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned number one that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that  while at the same time innocent people in the Donbas are getting killed by Russian soldiers.
333,6,0.797299164, You know we can do this without charging people  raising $30 trillion $40 trillion. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.
335,6,0.997665732,We should build on Obamacare provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here adding a Medicare option in that plan and not make people choose. Allow people to choose I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left you have to give up your private insurance. A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance. And if they don't like it
342,6,0.996315899,And I don't think it's a good idea that we mock  that we model ourselves after Trump and say lock him up. Look we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating  you know the next president starts tweeting should  anyway.
365,6,0.99241929,But one thing we haven't talked about here today we haven't talked  we talked about everything but we haven't talked about the one thing I think is most consequential.
381,6,0.995041532,Number two with Trump out of the way it's not going to change things in a fundamental way. But what it will do is it will mean that we're in a position where he's not going to be able to intimidate the base his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need in other things.
382,6,0.996062934,I refuse to accept the notion as some on this stage do that we can never never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that's the case we're dead as a country. We need to be able to reach a consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate it's me the way they've attacked me
384,6,0.994004598, We attempted to close Guantanamo Bay but you have to have congressional authority to do it. They've kept it open. And the fact is that we in fact think it's greatest  it is an advertisement for creating terror.
392,6,0.995772669,And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped we should be moving 60 percent of our sea power to that area of the world to let in fact the Chinese understand that they're not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks.
423,6,0.996538319, I don't think it is realistic but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. Remind everybody 20 million people got insurance who didn't have it before. All people with preexisting conditions were able to be covered. I could go on. We didn't get all that we wanted.
432,6,0.99691127,The idea that you're going to be able to save that person making $60000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. Sixteen percent of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me you're going to add 84 percent more and there's not going to be higher taxes? At least before he was honest about it.
14,7,0.995041532,Yes. You cannot let'as the mayor said you cannot let people who are sick no matter where they come from no matter what their status go uncovered. You can't do that. It's just going to be taking care of period. You have to. It's the humane thing to do.
26,7,0.996062934,when in fact my city was in flames because of the'the assassination of Dr. King number one. Now number two as the U.S.'as'excuse me'as the vice president of the United States I worked with a man who in fact we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major
34,7,0.898283932,Can I respond'
35,7,0.998291658,I have seen what happened just sense we were vice president. We needed three votes to pass an $800 billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression. I got three votes changed. We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate. And as recently as after the President got elected I was able to put together a coalition on the Cures Act that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan.
44,7,0.991264347,I don't'I don't buy that. The first'the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump.
60,7,0.963331876,So Mr. President let's get something straight:
87,7,0.996735411,The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. That woman the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.
90,7,0.996315899,In addition to that we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case that they don't  that they have to wait in line. The fact of the matter is you should be able to  if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back. It's a crime. It's a crime
92,7,0.997757044,I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense. Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum. People should have to get in line. That's the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.
96,7,0.99691127, The president came along and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever dealing with the dreamers. He put that in the law. He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the  laid before the Congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.
118,7,0.995041532,And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been  the police officer did something that did not give you information of what  your  your client. She didn't do that. She never did it. And so what happened.
122,7,0.963331876, I also invested $400 billion 
126,7,0.996315899, My plan calls for 500000 charging stations around the country so by 2030 we're all electric vehicles. My plan calls for making sure that we have $400 billion invested in technologies to learn how to contain what we're doing creating 10 million new jobs.
132,7,0.995041532,We invested significantly in this city when transportation only  anyway the point is we've made significant investment in this state. I expect in this city  I suspect that's why the mayor endorsed me.
138,7,0.977634638, No he said would I insist that labor be engaged?
146,7,0.995041532, The very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children. My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children. The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened.
189,7,0.996538319, Well first of all let me say that when I came back from law school I had a job with a great ' a bigtime law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated. We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months.
195,7,0.993304504, have access to be able to move along the way. I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is we've learned so much more more
223,7,0.983910504, I'm the vice president of the United States.
225,7,0.987436035, Secretary Castro would you want to respond to Vice President ?
234,7,0.997919791,And I think Elizabeth ' Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is China ' the problem isn't the trade deficit the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they're violating the WTO. They're dumping steel on us. That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us.
289,7,0.977634638, No no I'm not. No I'm not. I'm not.
304,7,0.99691127,I want to point out that the justices I've supported when I defeated Robert Bork  and I say when I defeated Robert Bork I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass we codify Roe v. Wade.
328,7,0.994572145, Well look the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump that's number one. And number two going to have to be able make be  be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That's what I'll do.
338,7,0.996315899,I've done it. I've brought people together. I'm always told by everybody around here things have changed you can't do that anymore. If we can't  I thought the question was initially asked of the senator how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly.
341,7,0.995041532,And so I would  whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported that I appointed let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it. But I would not direct it.
344,7,0.963331876, Can I respond very quickly?
357,7,0.997069151,We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with  I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30000 people were on the call young people between 15 and 25 and found out I said what do you need  what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools? You know what they said? Get men involved engage the rest of the community.
361,7,0.996538319,Secondly I'm  you know I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community in terms of my support. If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus
363,7,0.994004598,So my point is  my point is that one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition.
379,7,0.99756667,For example we shouldn't build another new highway in America that doesn't have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550000 charging stations so that we own the electrical vehicle market creating millions of jobs for people installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There are so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced
389,7,0.994004598,  Senator Warren is correct. We have led by not the example of our power but the power of our example. And the example we're demonstrating now is horrible. It's hurting us badly.
404,7,0.963331876, I was joking. That was a joke.
439,7,0.995772669,Look we all have big progressive plans. And the question is who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance the most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one who's most likely to do that?
18,8,0.998239197,The first thing I would do is unite families. I would surge immediately billions of dollars' worth of help to the region the immediately. Look I talk about foreign policy. I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign at the very end of our term to spend $740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that. We all talk about these things I did it. I did it.
23,8,0.685397626,That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
33,8,0.983910504,The first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was a young senator.
41,8,0.983910504,The first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was a young senator.
49,8,0.989694234,We know NATO will fall apart if he is elected for more years it is the single most consequential alliance'
50,8,0.997069151,Because once we'once Bush abuse that power what happened was we got elected after that. I made sure the president turned to me and said Joe get our combat troops out of Iraq. I was responsible for getting 150000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them. I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It's long overdue. It should end.
61,8,0.983910504, We love it. We are not leaving it. We are here to stay. And we're certainly not going to leave it to you.
62,8,0.991264347, Well my response is that the senator has had several plans so far. And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years you should wonder why it takes 10 years.
76,8,0.997841481,The fact of the matter is  the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible. It will be a deductible on their paycheck. Bernie acknowledges it. Bernie acknowledges it. Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid. And I don't know what math you do in New York I don't know what math you do in California but I tell ya that's a lot of money and there will be a deductible. The deductible will be out of your paycheck because that's what will be required.
77,8,0.994572145,Real quick. I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices flat out number one.
95,8,0.987436035, And by the way anybody that crosses the stage with a  with a  with a PhD you should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.
97,8,0.994004598,Lastly he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place. So he did  to compare him to Donald Trump I think is absolutely bizarre.
116,8,0.995041532, When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.
124,8,0.963331876, And that's bigger than any other person.
125,8,0.898283932, No I didn't say that.
141,8,0.963331876, Well I tell you what I hope you're part of it.
153,8,0.987436035, Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.
154,8,0.996538319," I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in. From the moment ""shock and awe"" started from that moment I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration."
155,8,0.997340982,Secondly I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq he turned and said Joe get our combat troops out in front of the entire national security team. One of the proudest moment of my life was to stand there in AlFaw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming  all our combat troops are coming home.
160,8,0.977634638,If you agree with me go to joe30330 and help me in this fight. Thank you very much.
169,8,0.996735411, Okay number one my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of ' the largest outofpocket payment you'll pay is $1000. You'll be able to get into a ' anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicaretype option we have et cetera.
184,8,0.963331876, Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.
185,8,0.989694234, Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid she would automatically be enrolled.
186,8,0.963331876, I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.
187,8,0.977634638, She ' you're automatically enrolled.
210,8,0.995436198, What Latinos should look at is ' comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous number one. We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things number one.
215,8,0.898283932,RAMOS:
218,8,0.898283932,RAMOS:
221,8,0.898283932,RAMOS:
224,8,0.898283932,RAMOS:
229,8,0.898283932,RAMOS:
244,8,0.994572145,"And it was later when we came into office that Barack turned ' the president turned to me and said ""Joe"" ' when they said we've got a plan to get out he turned to the whole security and said ""Joe will organize this. Get the troops home."""
246,8,0.898283932, You're right.
254,8,0.987436035, I ' I never counted any professional setback like I have as a serious setback. There's things that are important. Things that are unimportant.
259,8,0.994004598,And then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and ' with a terminal disease and a year later yearandahalf later losing him was like losing part of my soul.
260,8,0.99756667,But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose purpose in what you do. And that's why I hope ' I hope he's proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president but I stayed engaged because when you get hit badly whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family like my dad
261,8,0.99756667,And it just takes ' it just ' for me the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy. And ' but there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had. There are real heroes out there. Some real heroes.
263,8,0.995772669,This president ' and I agree with Bernie Senator Sanders ' is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all
267,8,0.995772669,Rudy Giuliani the president and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows if I get the nomination
290,8,0.996315899, But here  look but here's the deal. Think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he'll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is reelected I promise you there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated under  we will be in real trouble.
305,8,0.995436198,The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio Alabama et cetera who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And in fact every woman should have that right.
315,8,0.898283932, And we can afford to do it.
321,8,0.898283932, I did not say back to normal.
380,8,0.995436198, Look I didn't say return to normal. Normal's not enough. Normal  in fact we have to move beyond normal whether it's health care the environment whatever it is. We have to build on what we had started in our administration
403,8,0.643579329, Oh American history.
410,8,0.996062934,And I have made sure that you know exactly where all the  and the largest contribution I have accepted is $2800 which is allowed under law. And I'm the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is no  all public funding of elections. End all private funding.
411,8,0.99241929,And we all should take a commitment make a commitment to that right now on this stage. In the meantime you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign
437,8,0.995041532,The little kid who says I can't talk what do I do? I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with. And the reason I would give everyone here a gift is because they want to do something like I do of making their lives better because there's a lot of people who are hurting very very very badly.
438,8,0.977634638, I want to thank everyone listening seven days out from Christmas. Thank you very much.
3,9,0.997211676,What I am saying is that we've got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we  situation where there's continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is'is'is clean and they'they have water that they can drink.
4,9,0.997069151,Look Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.
29,9,0.987436035,Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.
30,9,0.977634638,The'the federal government must'
47,9,0.996315899,Number two we increased that background check when'when'during the Obama administration. I'm also the only guy that got assault weapons banned banned and the number of clips in a gun banned. And so folks look
81,9,0.995772669,Absolutely not number one. Number two everything landed on the president's desk but locusts. I found that Julian  excuse me  the secretary we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary.
101,9,0.994572145,(Inaudible) that's what we're talking about. That's what made us great. And the fact of the matter is I think the president of the United States Barack Obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.
108,9,0.998060518,In 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was  you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy; you  and engaged in stopandfrisk. You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal. You found yourself in a situation where three times as many AfricanAmerican kids were caught in that chain and caught up. The Justice Department came after you for saying you were  you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate and then in fact nothing happened the entire time you were mayor.
114,9,0.996315899,Number two we in fact insisted that we change the rules that police engage in. They had to have  we provided for body cameras. We made sure  there were a lot of things that were changed in the process but 38000 people in the federal system were released under the system.
115,9,0.997757044,And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done. But here's the deal. The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long long time ago. And now all of a sudden you know  I find it fascinating. Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties and he chose me and he said it was the best decision he made. I'll take his judgment.
117,9,0.994572145,And she did not  I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them. Secondly she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.
142,9,0.993304504, That was a long time ago and here's what it was about. It would have given people making today $100000 a year a tax break for childcare. I did not want that. I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100000. And that's what it was about.
149,9,0.898283932, I never believed it.
158,9,0.996538319,Look I've said it many times and I think everyone agrees with this. We're in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election anyone of you no matter how old or young you are has ever ever participated in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration  hard to overcome the damage he's done
159,9,0.997340982,Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let him know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. And we choose  we choose the idea that we can as Americans when we act together do anything. This is the United States of America. When we've acted together we have never never never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was.
168,9,0.995772669,I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for atrisk schools that are Title I schools from 15 to $45 billion a year. But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about I lay out how I can pay for it how I can get it done and why it's better.
178,9,0.996735411,And if you notice nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings the president thinks ' my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?
188,9,0.963331876, That'll be a surprise to him.
212,9,0.792080949,What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed. I would in fact make sure that there is ' we immediately surge to the border. All those people who are seeking asylum they deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation who says if you want to flee
214,9,0.995436198,And by the way retrospectively you know the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act. Now  back
228,9,0.99241929, I did not say I don't ' I stand with Barack Obama all eight years good bad and indifferent. That's where I stand. I did not say I did not stand with him.
230,9,0.995436198, Okay Senator Warren hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border. And recently in Mississippi we saw the largest immigration raid in a decade.
248,9,0.994004598,Number two make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home we need ' we have one school psychologist for every 1500 kids in America today. It's crazy.
274,9,0.898283932, We can stand up to them.
277,9,0.977634638,Secondly the idea that we in fact engage in this notion that there are  there's $16400
287,9,0.995041532,But the fact of the matter is we have been unwilling in this administration because we have an erratic crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection.
291,9,0.996062934,And with regard to regime change in Syria that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.
299,9,0.995041532,I know what has to be done. I will not need any onthejob training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records as I have 21 years of my tax records which no one else on this stage has done so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.
323,9,0.997211676,The two people maybe would surprise you the most were  he's been mentioned twice but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was  he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.
339,9,0.996315899,And lastly to be commanderinchief there's no time for onthejob training. I've spent more time in the Situation Room more time abroad more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader. They know me and they know when I speak
351,9,0.997211676,But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world. He's embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is  his whole effort is to break up NATO to increase his power. Look what he's done to  and so this guy has no idea what he's doing. He has no notion how to go about it. And we need a commanderinchief who when he stands everybody knows what he or she is talking about.
359,9,0.994004598, I'll be very brief. Number one I think we should decriminalize marijuana period. And I think everyone  anyone who has a record should be let out of jail their records expunged be completely zeroed out.
364,9,0.995041532, I assume we're only talking about the corruption of the federal government. We weren't talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress.
391,9,0.99241929, It's on a collision course with China but not for war. What we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what they've done. A million Uighurs as you pointed out Muslims
397,9,0.983910504, And I'm going to guess he wasn't talking about me either.
399,9,0.898283932,XXX about me either.
400,9,0.997665732, Number one. Look I'm running  I'm running because I've been around on my experience. With experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that we're in a position now the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things an economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be  where we have to unite America. And a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able to on day one stand up look out
420,9,0.991264347,That's been my position from the beginning. That's why I think Secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren't happy with me.
422,9,0.996538319, Since 2009 go back and look. I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon. The only reason I can speak to it now is because it's been published. It's been published thoroughly. I'm the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly.
429,9,0.898283932, My name was mentioned.
434,9,0.898283932, It's the first time I did this.
31,10,0.983910504,I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for .
32,10,0.997665732,I'I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody once they in fact'my time is up. I'm sorry.
37,10,0.670758108,And guess what? We beat them. We won back the Senate.
39,10,0.983910504,I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for.
40,10,0.997665732,I'I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody once they in fact'my time is up. I'm sorry.
51,10,0.997757044,And I thirdly I believe that you are not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism. So I would eliminate the'the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AU and fan make sure that it could only be used for what it's intended'what its intent was and that is to go after terrorist but never do it alone. That is why we have to repair our alliances. We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places. That is what I would do. That is what I have done and I know how to do it.
54,10,0.994572145,I am secondly running for President because I think we have to restore the backbone of America. The poor and hardworking middleclass people. You can't do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.
65,10,0.993304504,Secondly it will require middleclass taxes to go up not down. Thirdly it will eliminate employerbased insurance. And fourthly what happens in the meantime?
80,10,0.72520473,And lastly here's the deal. The deal is let's figure out how this works. We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like no matter what one it is and buy into a Medicare option. And they can buy the gold plan
91,10,0.898283932,I agree.
110,10,0.898283932, I'm sorry 
156,10,0.577783102, I opposed the surge in Afghanistan this long overdue  we should have not in fact gone into Afghanistan the way
161,10,0.99691127, You know when President Kennedy announced the moon shot he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said we're doing it because we refuse to postpone. Well I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer Alzheimer's
171,10,0.99241929,Number two the fact of the matter is we're in a situation where if you notice he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor honesty
193,10,0.997458827,We ' I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison we have to equip them that when they get out ' nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released ' they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned.
197,10,0.995436198, Because I got it done before. I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA 'only one ever to beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into ' into focus and became law.
198,10,0.99691127,And so that's number one. Number two after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. It went from a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now. Mothers ' the organization ' mothers against violence ' gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington making sure that things are going to change.
209,10,0.898283932, Go beat them.
216,10,0.821892302, Yeah but you didn't answer the question.
217,10,0.963331876, Well I did answer the question.
219,10,0.963331876, No did you make a mistake with those deportations?
241,10,0.99691127,With regard to ' with regard to Iraq the fact of the matter is that you know I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed he said to go in and get the Security Council to vote 150 to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened
245,10,0.888221893,My son spent a year in Iraq and I understand. It made ' and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made which we predicted was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming ' from moving in.
252,10,0.995436198,Because here's the deal. The deal is that we've got this a little backwards. And by the way in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I've confronted Maduro.
256,10,0.898283932, I'm sorry.
257,10,0.995041532, There's setbacks and there's setbacks. And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose ' well my dad had an expression. He said Joey it's not a question of succeeding whether you get knocked down
262,10,0.994004598, Yes they have. I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background what he did all the accusations in the Mueller Report
270,10,0.995041532,My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.
280,10,0.898283932, See I'm doing the same thing.
286,10,0.99691127, I think I maybe  it doesn't make me any better or worse but maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that  you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO  he understands if he's out of NATO he's in real trouble.
288,10,0.996062934,"Think what's happened. The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says ""I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don't believe our intelligence community."""
292,10,0.991264347,And lastly and I apologize for going on but lastly what is happening in Iraq is going to  I mean excuse me in Afghanistan
293,10,0.995772669, I'm the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred.
297,10,0.997069151,Look one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.
300,10,0.898283932, Before the first vote.
302,10,0.99241929, Well before Iowa. I mean look I've released them before. I released 55 pages of my  I'm the only guy that's released anything up here.
303,10,0.995041532, I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around we lose control they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.
307,10,0.898283932,And by the way if in fact at the end of this  beginning next year if in fact
318,10,0.994572145, I agree. Let me  she d me. I agreed with the great job she did and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight too.
331,10,0.995772669,Secondly I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president. So I  I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that  that are being held. But the bottom line is I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question:
350,10,0.996062934,And in Japan and Australia and being a Pacific power and putting pressure on China in order  for them to make sure that it is a non  it is a nuclearfree peninsula. And the way we do that is we make clear to China which I have done personally with  with the president of China and that is we're going to move up our defenses
360,10,0.994004598,But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the longterm effects are for the use of marijuana. That's all it is. Number one everybody gets out record expunged.
394,10,0.993304504,We should be going to the U.N. immediately and sought sanctions against them in the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We don't have to go to war. But we have to make it clear this is as far as you go China.
395,10,0.993304504,And in terms of their military buildup it's real. But it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are. We're not looking for a war. But we've got to make clear we are a Pacific power and we are not going to back away.
401,10,0.987436035,And that's what  that's the reason I'm running. I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage.
408,10,0.963331876, My average contributions is $43 number one. That's number one.
416,10,0.898283932, Afghanistan you said?
417,10,0.99691127, The reason I can speak to this  it's wellknown if any of you followed it my view on Afghanistan  I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was no comprehensive policy available. And then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nationbuilding notion we set about.
426,10,0.58494926, I know. So look it covers everybody. It's realistic. And most importantly it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people who negotiated their health care plans with their employer like many of you have. You may or may not like it. If you don't like it you can move into the public option that I propose in my plan. But if you like it
441,10,0.996735411,And thirdly who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done from Violence Against Women Act to the chemical weapons treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike.
